- Cargo

## Compatibility

### Tested Versions

These contracts have been developed and tested with the following versions:

- **Soroban SDK**: `21.0.0`
- **Soroban CLI**: `21.0.0`
- **Rust Toolchain**: `stable` (with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and `wasm32v1-none` targets)
- **Protocol Version**: Compatible with Stellar Protocol 20+ (Soroban Phase 1)
- **Network**: Testnet and Mainnet ready

### Version Compatibility Matrix

| Component | Version | Status | Notes |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------|
| soroban-sdk | 21.0.0 | ✅ Tested | Current stable release |
| soroban-cli | 21.0.0 | ✅ Tested | Matches SDK version |
| Protocol 20 | - | ✅ Compatible | Soroban Phase 1 features |
| Protocol 21+ | - | ⚠️ Untested | Should be compatible, validation recommended |

### Upgrading to New Soroban Versions

When a new Soroban SDK or protocol version is released, follow these steps to validate and upgrade:

#### 1. Review Release Notes

Check the [Soroban SDK releases](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/releases) for:
- Breaking changes in contract APIs
- New features or optimizations
- Deprecated functions
- Protocol version requirements

#### 2. Update Dependencies

Update the SDK version in all contract `Cargo.toml` files:

```toml
[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = "X.Y.Z"

[dev-dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { version = "X.Y.Z", features = ["testutils"] }
```

Contracts to update:
- `remittance_split/Cargo.toml`
- `savings_goals/Cargo.toml`
- `bill_payments/Cargo.toml`
- `insurance/Cargo.toml`
- `family_wallet/Cargo.toml`
- `data_migration/Cargo.toml`
- `reporting/Cargo.toml`
- `orchestrator/Cargo.toml`

#### 3. Update Soroban CLI

```bash
cargo install --locked --version X.Y.Z soroban-cli
```

Verify installation:
```bash
soroban version
```

#### 4. Run Full Test Suite

```bash
# Clean build artifacts
cargo clean

# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run gas benchmarks to check for performance regressions
./scripts/run_gas_benchmarks.sh
```

#### 5. Validate on Testnet

Deploy contracts to testnet and run integration tests:

```bash
# Build optimized contracts
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Deploy to testnet
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/<contract_name>.wasm \
  --source <your-key> \
  --network testnet

# Test contract interactions
soroban contract invoke \
  --id <contract-id> \
  --source <your-key> \
  --network testnet \
  -- <function-name> <args>
```

#### 6. Check for Breaking Changes

Common breaking changes to watch for:

- **Storage API changes**: TTL management, archival patterns
- **Event emission**: Topic structure or data format changes
- **Authorization**: Auth context or signature verification changes
- **Numeric types**: Changes to `i128`, `u128`, or fixed-point math
- **Contract lifecycle**: Initialization or upgrade patterns

#### 7. Update Documentation

After successful validation:
- Update this compatibility section with new versions
- Document any migration steps in `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- Update code examples if APIs changed
- Regenerate contract bindings if needed

### Known Breaking Changes

#### SDK 21.0.0 (Current)

No breaking changes from previous stable releases affecting these contracts.

#### Future Considerations

- **Protocol 21+**: May introduce new storage pricing or TTL requirements
- **SDK 22.0.0+**: Monitor for changes to contract storage patterns, event APIs, or authorization flows

### Network Protocol Versions

The contracts are designed to be compatible with:

- **Testnet**: Currently running Protocol 20+
- **Mainnet**: Currently running Protocol 20+

Check current network protocol versions:
```bash
# Testnet
soroban network container logs stellar 2>&1 | grep "protocol version"

# Or via RPC
curl -X POST https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getNetwork","params":[]}'
```

### Troubleshooting Version Issues

**Build Errors After Upgrade:**
```bash
# Clear all caches
cargo clean
rm -rf target/
rm Cargo.lock

# Rebuild
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

**Test Failures:**
- Check for deprecated test utilities in SDK release notes
- Verify mock contract behavior hasn't changed
- Review event emission format changes

**Deployment Issues:**
- Ensure CLI version matches SDK version
- Verify network is running compatible protocol version
- Check for new deployment flags or requirements

## Events

All contracts emit events for important state changes, enabling real-time tracking and frontend integration. Events follow Soroban best practices and include:

- **Relevant IDs**: All events include the ID of the entity being acted upon
- **Amounts**: Financial events include transaction amounts
- **Timestamps**: All events include the ledger timestamp for accurate tracking
- **Context Data**: Additional contextual information (names, dates, etc.)

### Event Topics

Each contract uses short symbol topics for efficient event identification:
- **Remittance Split**: `init`, `calc`
- **Savings Goals**: `created`, `added`, `completed`
- **Bill Payments**: `created`, `paid`, `recurring`
- **Insurance**: `created`, `paid`, `deactive`
- **Family Wallet**: `added/member`, `updated/limit`, `emerg/*`, `wallet/*`

### Querying Events

Events can be queried from the Stellar network using the Soroban SDK or via the Horizon API for frontend integration. Each event structure is exported and can be decoded using the contract's schema.

## Testing

Run tests for all contracts:

```bash
cargo test
```

Run tests for a specific contract:

```bash
cd remittance_split
cargo test
```

### Cross-Contract Invariant Tests

Verify that allocations across contracts are consistent with remittance splits:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify_cross_contract_invariants.py
```

See [scripts/README_INVARIANT_TESTS.md](scripts/README_INVARIANT_TESTS.md) for details.

### USDC remittance split checks (local & CI)

- `cargo test -p remittance_split` exercises the USDC distribution logic with a mocked Stellar Asset Contract (`env.register_stellar_asset_contract_v2`) and built-in auth mocking.
- The suite covers minting the payer account, splitting across spending/savings/bills/insurance, and asserting balances along with the new allocation metadata helper.
- The same command is intended for CI so it runs without manual setup; re-run locally whenever split logic changes or new USDC paths are added.

## Gas Benchmarks

RemitWise includes a comprehensive gas benchmarking harness for tracking and optimizing contract performance.

### Quick Start

Run all benchmarks and generate a JSON report:

```bash
./scripts/run_gas_benchmarks.sh
```

This creates `gas_results.json` with CPU and memory costs for all contract operations.

### Regression Detection

Compare current results against baseline to detect performance regressions:

```bash
./scripts/compare_gas_results.sh benchmarks/baseline.json gas_results.json
```

The comparison fails if CPU or memory increases exceed configured thresholds (default 10%).

### Update Baseline

After verifying optimizations:

```bash
./scripts/update_baseline.sh
```

### Documentation

- **[Benchmarking Guide](benchmarks/README.md)**: Complete benchmarking documentation
- **[Gas Optimization Guide](docs/gas-optimization.md)**: Optimization strategies and best practices
- **[Baseline Results](benchmarks/baseline.json)**: Current performance baseline
- **[Threshold Configuration](benchmarks/thresholds.json)**: Regression detection thresholds

### CI Integration

Gas benchmarks run automatically in CI on every push and pull request. Results are:
- Compared against baseline for regression detection
- Uploaded as artifacts (retained for 30 days)
- Posted as PR comments with comparison details

To view CI results:
1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select a workflow run
3. Download the `gas-benchmarks` artifact
4. View `gas_results.json` for metrics

### Individual Contract Benchmarks

Run benchmarks for a specific contract:

```bash
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test -p bill_payments --test gas_bench -- --nocapture
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test -p savings_goals --test gas_bench -- --nocapture
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test -p insurance --test gas_bench -- --nocapture
